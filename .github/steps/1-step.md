## Step 1: Setting Up Your Business Analysis Environment

You are a Business Analyst working for ABC Insurance Company.
You are tasked to analyze how to introduce WhatsApp into their
claims process. They want to replace the current legacy system
with a new straight-through process driven via WhatsApp.

In this step, you'll learn to set up Visual Studio Code with GitHub
Copilot and MCP (Model Context Protocol) to streamline your 
requirements gathering process.

### 📖 Theory: Modern Business Analysis Tools

> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio Code isn't just for developers! Business analysts 
can leverage its powerful features, extensions, and AI capabilities
to create structured, version-controlled requirements documents.

**Key Benefits for Business Analysts:**
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-powered assistance for writing requirements, user stories, and documentation
- **MCP Integration**: Connect to external data sources and APIs to gather contextual information
- **Version Control**: Track changes to requirements documents using Git
- **Collaborative Features**: Share and review requirements with stakeholders
- **Structured Documentation**: Use Markdown for consistent, readable requirements

### ⌨️ Activity: Configure Your BA Workspace

1. **Open Visual Studio Code** and ensure GitHub Copilot is active (look for the Copilot icon in the status bar)

2. **Create a new requirements document**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette
   - Type "New File" and select it
   - Save the file as `whatsapp-claims-requirements.md`

3. **Test GitHub Copilot for requirements writing**:
   - Start typing: `# WhatsApp Claims Process Requirements`
   - Press `Enter` and begin typing: `## Functional Requirements`
   - Notice how Copilot suggests relevant content

4. **Explore MCP capabilities** (if available):
   - Use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Search for MCP-related commands to connect to external data sources
   - This will help you gather real-time information about current claims processes

5. **Set up your workspace structure**:
   ```
   whatsapp-claims-project/
   ├── requirements/
   │   ├── functional-requirements.md
   │   ├── non-functional-requirements.md
   │   └── user-stories.md
   ├── stakeholders/
   │   └── stakeholder-analysis.md
   └── process-maps/
       └── current-state.md
   ```

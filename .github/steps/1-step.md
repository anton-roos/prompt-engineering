## Step 1: Setting Up Your Prompt Engineering Environment

You are a professional learning to use AI tools effectively.
Your goal is to master prompt engineering techniques that will
make you more productive in your daily work, whether you're
writing content, analyzing data, or solving problems.

In this step, you'll learn to set up Visual Studio Code with GitHub
Copilot to start crafting and testing effective prompts.

### 📖 Theory: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

> [!NOTE]
> Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective 
instructions for AI models. A well-written prompt can mean the 
difference between getting a vague response and getting exactly 
what you need.

**Key Benefits of Good Prompt Engineering:**
- **Precision**: Get specific, actionable responses
- **Efficiency**: Reduce back-and-forth iterations with AI
- **Consistency**: Reliable results for similar tasks
- **Control**: Guide AI to follow your preferred style and format
- **Productivity**: Accomplish complex tasks faster

### ⌨️ Activity: Set Up Your Prompt Engineering Workspace

1. **Open Visual Studio Code** and ensure GitHub Copilot is active (look for the Copilot icon in the status bar)

2. **Create a new prompt document**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette
   - Type "New File" and select it
   - Save the file as `my-prompts.md`

3. **Test GitHub Copilot for prompt creation**:
   - Start typing: `# My Prompt Engineering Collection`
   - Press `Enter` and begin typing: `## Zero-Shot Prompts`
   - Notice how Copilot suggests relevant content

4. **Create your workspace structure**:
   ```
   prompt-engineering-practice/
   ├── prompts/
   │   ├── zero-shot-prompts.md
   │   ├── few-shot-prompts.md
   │   └── chain-of-thought-prompts.md
   ├── examples/
   │   └── prompt-templates.md
   └── practice/
       └── daily-prompts.md
   ```

5. **Practice with basic prompt structures**:
   - **Zero-shot**: Direct instructions without examples
   - **Few-shot**: Instructions with 1-3 examples
   - **Chain-of-thought**: Step-by-step reasoning prompts

# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

This course teaches you how to craft effective prompts using simple GitHub Actions, no developer experience required.

## Overview of Workflows

1. **Initialize Template**
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in this repository.
   - Select **Initialize Prompts Document** and click **Run workflow**.
   - A `prompts.md` file will be created with three sections: Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought.

2. **Fill In Your Prompts**
   - Open the newly created `prompts.md` file.
   - Add your own prompts under each heading and paste the AI responses.
   - Commit your changes to a new branch and open a Pull Request (PR) to `main`.

3. **Validation on Pull Request**
   - The **Validate Prompts** workflow will automatically run.
   - It checks for the three required sections and leaves feedback in the PR.
   - If sections are missing, update your file and push again.

4. **Celebrate Completion**
   - Once your PR is merged, the **Celebrate Completion** workflow posts a congratulatory comment.

# Introduction to Prompt Engineering

*Learn the basics of crafting effective prompts for AI models like Grok or ChatGPT.*

## Welcome

Prompt engineering is the art of designing inputs (prompts) to get the best outputs from AI models. This course will teach you foundational techniques through hands-on exercises in GitHub.

- **Who is this for**: Beginners interested in AI, developers, writers, or anyone curious about interacting with large language models.
- **What you'll learn**: Key concepts like zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and best practices for clear prompts.
- **What you'll build**: A `prompts.md` file documenting various prompt techniques and their results.
- **Prerequisites**: Access to an AI tool (e.g., grok.com, ChatGPT). No prior GitHub experience needed—we'll guide you.
- **How long**: Less than 30 minutes, with 4 steps.

### How to start this course

1. Above this section, locate the menu that begins with **Start course** ... right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, follow the prompts to create a copy of this template in your account. We recommend creating a public repository—private repositories may limit functionality.
3. After your copy is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're reading right now). GitHub Actions will automatically update this section with the next steps. :balloon:

## Step 1: Your First Prompt (Zero-Shot Prompting)

*You've created your repository—great start! Now let's write your first prompt.*

Zero-shot prompting means giving the AI a task without examples—it relies on the model's pre-training.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create and commit a basic prompt

1. Create a new file called `prompts.md`.
2. Add the following content:
